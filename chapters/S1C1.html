											<p style="font-size:20px;">The rain beats down heavily on the OnionRing at 4am in the morning. The wind is menial, the animals are silent. The only sound is the steady pitter patter of raindrops. Suddenly, a sound akin to what happens when you place a brick in a washing machine and set it to ‘heavy fabric’ roared out of the darkness; the familiar explosive tune of the Dodge HellSpawn SRTBBQ.<br /><br />
	POW POW POW POW POW POW BLEWM. The SRTBBQ’s singular front tire moves to the left of the car in order to facilitate a full drift. Gub, our hero, reached over all the way to the right of his beloved motorcar in order to reach the gearshift. He had opted for the manual version of the SRTBBQ and wanted to shift down to gear 24 from gear 25 for the turn. With great zeal, he screeched ‘MOGYAAA’ and shifted the Dodge down a gear, resulting in 5 gallons of oil and a flaming hamburger bun being ejected onto the street from the SRTBBQ’s exhaust in a glorious backfire display and landing with a satisfying splat, flowing into the sandy area of the track. Once again, gub placed his foot down on the accelerator and rocketed forward with the speed of the Car Gods at his tires, pushing him forth as he lost a quarter inch of tire from the massive weight transfer he just performed. In a fantastic drift, the car careened nearly sidewards and broke the side rail barrier as Gub and his car shot down the face of the mountain on which the OnionRing was on in the greatest sideways drift the world had ever seen. He turned off the car and allowed the drift to continue as his car rattled sideways down the cliff face. It was time to take a nap.<br /><br />
	Gub awoke in the middle of a three car car crash, luckily the other motorcars were made of silly papier mache import materials so it was only his car which actually survived. Thank god for American engineering. Gub then reached over and used a grabby hand toy to shift his SRTBBQ down to reverse gear, then back up to 7th gear in order to pull out of the crash. He cruised towards his father’s cigarette shop blissfully, pleased with the job he had done.
‘Gub, we are move to Tokyo, USA. I have found job programming cigarettes there, for the best company aggle. I know I have only been here for a month but I think it's time we move again.’ says his father. It didn’t hit him at first, but he soon realized he’d have to leave his old life behind. In disappointment, Gub chain smoked 11 more cigarettes and returned to his bedroom to contemplate the change of pace in his life.<br /><br />
The next morning, Gub had time to think when he was sitting in the BMW proprietary family vehicle, a German car. He wondered how he would start his new life. He kicked back and lit another cigarette. He know that it would be different but he would have to adjust. Driving culture was different in the asian realm he was traveling too, but he figured he’d find some of his people there. He set up his absolutely jarring mixtape of female sounds and piano music and set to work thinking of what he would do once he got there. It was going to be a long trip.
