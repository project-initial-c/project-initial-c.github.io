											<p style="font-size:20px;">Takahashi Agala’s FD skidded laterally down the mountain road, miraculously countersteering just enough so that it didn’t careen into the guardrail and continued driving down the course. “I knew it,” he said. “If I get serious, nobody can keep up with me.” He checked his rear view mirrors, and in between all the RED STARS stickers, he saw no headlights. “Everyone here is still at that level.”<br /><br />
Through the stickerbombed cracked mirrors, a pair of pop-up headlights appeared.
“Finally caught up, huh?” murmered Agala. “Hey- that’s not one of ours.”
The headlights drew closer.<br /><br />
“Is that an Evo or a GTR? What else could keep up with my beloved FD?” Agala postulated out loud.<br /><br />
The headlights were glaring through the stickers on his mirrors now.
“Your driving is satisfactory- However! In two more corners, I won’t even see you in my mirrors!” Exclaimed Agala as he shifted down and caused the equivalent of a gunpowder explosion coming out of his rear exhaust, an aftermarket part which exemplified the rotary’s glorious sound. Consequently, the exhaust in its entirety was wrenched off of the pipe and flew off the mountain side with the muffler, barely missing the car behind him.<br /><br />
They careened into the first corner, and entered a flashy nearly lateral drift. Agala took a glance at the car next to him. “An FC?! You have to be kidding me!”
They exited the corner and Agala gained more ground on the straightaway, but this advantage was immediately lost in the next corner where the FC entered an even flashier drift than before and instantly closed the gap between them.<br /><br />
“My beautiful FD can’t outrun an old FC?! What kind of nightmare is this?” Yelled Agala in frustration. “I’m the number 1 driver of the Tokyopur Red Stars!”<br /><br />
Agala pushed his foot down on the aftermarket cardboard brake pedal he’d installed. After he sold his metal pedals for money, he insisted the cardboard ‘weight reduction’ mods would save money as well. He slowed down and prepared to take the next corner as one usually would, but was amazed to see the FC rocket past him, going at full gas.<br /><br />
“What an idiot! Doesn’t he know this part of the track? This slow right turn is followed by a sharp left! If he doesn’t slow down now, he’ll tumble down the mountain into the slums where the non-STEM students live!” Gasped Agala. He gripped the aftermarket plastic steering wheel labeled ‘MOMMO’ and leaned forward in his ‘Sarpco’ bucket seat. <br /><br />
The rear of the FC began to swing out from behind it as the older RX-7 lost traction.<br /><br />
Agala noticed this and yelled, “I knew it! Overspeed! There’s no more room for him to slow down, and he’s done for!”<br /><br />
Instantly, the FC spun around in the other direction and lined up totally laterally with the road. The exhaust backfired as the car engaged in a full drift, barely losing any speed at all.<br /><br />
Takahashi Agala was aghast, “I...I...INERTIA DRIFT??!” being the only question he managed to choke out as he took on the corner at a normal speed. “What in Computer Science’s name?!”<br /><br />
The FC easily pulled ahead of Agala and grumbled down the mountain with a steady stream of flaming oil spilling out of the exhaust. Agala continued down the mountain, a portion of his astronomical ego destroyed. He stopped in a passing zone and checked his 10 dollar ‘Rollex’ watch. ‘12 AM, time to change the oil.’ He popped the hood of his beloved FD and pulled out the oil dipstick, unzipped his pants and took a leak into the oil sump. “Ah yes, maintenance complete.” Miraculously, the FD started up once again and he took it down the mountain, back to his house.
