											<p style="font-size:20px;">Upon arrival, Gub awakens and sees the great mount Mog in the Distance. So this was the only place outside of the city limits. As he looked out the window, he expected to see hot girls in S2Ks but instead saw mustachioed indian and asian girls playing the piano while sitting in the back of Mercedes and Lexuses. They were probably on their way to SAT class. ‘Charming’, he thought. This was going to be a little different from his expectation of the place.<br /><br />
Gub exited the car and went up the stairs in the 500 floor apartment building to reach his apartment. He went into the quaint dwelling and got to bed. It was 10pm, but the Pear software company’s employees, who all worked until 12:00 AM sharp were still hard at work, in order to maintain their family’s honor. What a lovely place, Gub thought to himself. He dozed off to sleep.<br /><br />
The next morning, he awoke to a pleasant sight. Persons of questionable citizenship had arranged his entire house into a livable environment, and his computer was up and running. Gub opened up his computer and decided to use his unlimited money from his father’s lucrative career to purchase a vehicle. After scrolling through the unfamiliar and extremely Japanese selections, he was too frustrated with all the choices and decided to figure it out later. He put on some stylish clothing and hoofed it to Internment High School. On the way, he was stopped at three academic checkpoints, manned by Indian boys wearing polo shirts with the collars ruffled all over the place. He was asked to present his transcript. After showing them he had achieved above a 2.5 GPA his last semester in America, at We the People High School, they let him pass the checkpoint. Finally, Gub was allowed to enter Internment high school. ‘Wow,’ he commented nonchalantly. ‘This place seems extremely terrible.’ He turned his attention to the ‘Loading zone’, with a description spelled out in English, Spanish, Chinese, and all 5.9 million Indian subdialects. He looked a little further down the Loading zone and saw that it had been converted to a landing strip. Lining the runway were aircraft labelled ‘AIR INDIA’ and ‘AIR CHINA’, aircraft shipping in more children on visas eager to study in Tokyopur, USA near the Pear software engineering company. Gub shook his head, as some of these people couldn’t even speak english. He had to avoid being crushed as they were airdropped in crates. They were simply studying machines. He walked on further into the school, where the customary Pride Parade was taking place as it did on the daily. ‘Respectable,’ he thought. ‘But only respectable’. He walked further and began his schooling. It was going to be a long week.<br /><br />
During the lunch break, Gub went outside and witnessed the glory of cars in this new land for the first time. The landing strip on which the infinite H1B visas arrived had been converted into a racing track, but not just any racing track. He tapped a socially inept looking fellow who was wearing headphones and eating pages out of a textbook labelled ‘CALCULUS, FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS’ and asked,
“Young man, what’s going on there?’<br /><br />
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa”, spouted the fellow, well versed in differential equations but unable to communicate in English due to his major devotion to his studies and lack of communication. Gub whipped out his phone and commissioned Pear translate to take care of it, and he read the message on the screen:<br /><br />
<code>Well sir, it seems you’re witnessing for the first time the Takahashi Agala and Iketani Mallah perform the drift race. Currently, they’re illegally racing their cars in the parking lot. The yellow FD there, belongs to Takahashi Agala. He’s the greatest brown man you will ever encounter here. The Datsun 240z keeping up with him would be that of Iketani Mallah. He’s probably a terrorist. Both of them are currently racing practice runs to try their luck on mount Mog.</code><br /><br />
Fascinated, Gub thanked the poor fellow by leaving an English dictionary on top of his oversized iPad and poured some sugar on the textbook pages he was eating. He patted the poor creature on the back and went to the front to witness the occurrence. <br /><br />
It seemed that the race finished. He looked down at the man who had won as he stepped out of the yellow RX-7 FD, but only after revving it excessively to the irritation of the entire crowd. The fellow was wearing a T-shirt that read TOKYOPUR HACKS and had a list of software engineering companies on the back, and a pair of ratty jeans. His shoes seemed cheap and fake, but the arrogance emanating from him was unmistakable. This was the man who had won. Takahashi Agala waved to the crowd and received applause in return. Gub was appalled at how such a seemingly toxic person could be so well accepted by the general population.<br /><br />
The other fellow, Iketani Mallah, stepped out of his car and adjusted his glasses. He was about the same height of Takahashi Agala, but slightly taller. He wiped his brow with an apron labelled ‘QUEER KYTCHEN’ and grinned. Although he had barely lost this practice race, he was satisfied with the result.<br /><br />
Amidst the cheering, Gub walked into the pits with the two racers, and waved. “Hello, are you the fastest racers in this town?” he asked in a complete deadpan.
Ignoring his question, Takahashi Agala answered first, “You dress very sharply, but your choice in pants speaks something rather queer,” he said. “I am a student here at Internment High School, and I’m the fastest racer down the mountain pass. I’m with the Red Stars racing team.”<br /><br />
“Very interesting,” said Gub. “Want to lose your first race?” he prodded.
“Your offer to battle is intriguing, since I don’t see your car in sight.” Agala grinned and gestured to the empty space behind Gub. Humiliated, Gub realized his father had sold his SRTBBQ in exchange for one day’s rent in this extremely gentrified town.<br /><br />
“Yes,” Iketani Mallah commented. “You’ll need a vehicle first to race any of our teams. By the way, I’m Iketani Mallah. I’m with the Tokyopur Speed Suns. We’re the local racing gang, and these are my friends.’ He motioned towards the general area behind him, which seemed to be a cesspool of problematic looking fellows.
“You are all very intriguing people,” exclaimed Gub. “I seek to get a car and race you.”<br /><br />
“Hm. My RX-7 FD is the state of the art Japanese Rotary Car. I was able to afford this glorious vehicle with my 3.8 GPA.” stated Agala. The crowd murmured quietly, impressed. “If you think you can bring any vehicle that can challenge me in battle, prepare to be disappointed.” Agala sat back in his FD and revved the engine, then BRAAAPPED out of the parking lot in a cloud of engine smoke. He stopped outside the Loading zone to add some more oil to his FD and then continued his drive out. Mallah started up his 240z after 12 tries of the ignition, and once he got the ancient engine revving, he also cruised out of the parking lot.<br /><br />
Gub was amazed at what he saw that day. These cars were nothing like what he saw before. To think that the rotary engine was so prevalent. Wow. He must change this.
Immediately, he hopped on Noodle, the prevalent search engine, and looked up a car that was of his liking. He clicked around until he found the epitome of Japanese drift vehicling. Small, light, powerful, box shaped, requiring thousands of dollars of maintenance, and moddable with cool looking brake lights. Gub had found the only vehicle that could rival Agala’s FD. With a few clicks, an AMAZONE drone was already on its way with his vehicle. Gub clapped his hands together in success. He jogged down the stairs of his cube home, which housed approximately 3000 more people per square decameter. <br /><br />
In his garage, he saw his slightly shiny new used car. He picked up a wrench and lay down on his proprietary Ubermensch creeper seat. It was time to get to work on the FC. He threw his wrench at full speed into the underbody of the car, and by pure luck completely reset the entire engine and knocked over the cup of jello he had left on the hood of the car. The hood popped open, and the jello seeped inside, repairing all the apex seals in the engine instantly. How fantastic.
Satisfied with his work, Gub closed down the doors of his garage and went to grab some quick dinner of absolutely nothing before he came back down to start the FC. He was planning on taking it for a spin.
