							<h2>The Ghost of Mount Mog</h2>
							<p>Takahashi Agala’s FD skidded laterally down the mountain road, miraculously countersteering just enough so that it didn’t careen into the guardrail and continued driving down the course. “I knew it,” he said. “If I get serious, nobody can keep up with me.” He checked his rear view mirrors, and in between all the RED STARS stickers, he saw no headlights. “Everyone here is still at that level.”</p>

							<h2>Arrival</h2>
							<p>Upon arrival, Gub awakens and sees the great mount Mog in the Distance. So this was the only place outside of the city limits. As he looked out the window, he expected to see hot girls in S2Ks but instead saw mustachioed indian and asian girls playing the piano while sitting in the back of Mercedes and Lexuses. They were probably on their way to SAT class. ‘Charming’, he thought. This was going to be a little different from his expectation of the place.

							<h2>Prologue</h2>
							<p>AThe rain beats down heavily on the OnionRing at 4am in the morning. The wind is menial, the animals are silent. The only sound is the steady pitter patter of raindrops. Suddenly, a sound akin to what happens when you place a brick in a washing machine and set it to ‘heavy fabric’ roared out of the darkness; the familiar explosive tune of the Dodge HellSpawn SRTBBQ.</p>
